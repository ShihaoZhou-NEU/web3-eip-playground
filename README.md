# Web3 EIP Playground

An interactive Web3 education playground for learning ERC / EIP by doing, not reading.

---

## 🌍 What is this?

**Web3 EIP Playground** is an educational Web3 application designed for beginners.

Instead of reading long and abstract technical documents, learners can:
- play simple mini-games  
- read short comic-style explanations  
- interact with real smart contracts  
- ask questions to an AI tutor  

and gradually understand what ERC / EIP are, why they exist, and how they work in practice.

## ❓ Why are we building this?

Many ERCs and EIPs are difficult to understand if you only read official technical documentation.

This project aims to:
- lower the learning barrier for Web3 beginners  
- explain standards in a visual and interactive way  
- help students build intuition through hands-on experience  

We believe **standards should be learned through usage, not memorization**.
