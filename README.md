# 🎮 EIP Playground

> **Learn Ethereum Standards by Playing, Not Just Reading.**

**EIP Playground** is a gamified, pixel-art themed educational platform designed to make Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Request for Comments (ERCs) accessible to everyone. Through interactive mini-games, comics, and an AI tutor, we turn abstract technical specifications into intuitive, hands-on experiences.

---

## 🌍 What is this?

**EIP Playground** is an educational Web3 application designed for beginners.

Instead of reading long and abstract technical documents, learners can:
- play simple mini-games  
- read short comic-style explanations  
- interact with real smart contracts  
- ask questions to an AI tutor  

and gradually understand what ERC / EIP are, why they exist, and how they work in practice.

---

## ❓ Why are we building this?

Many ERCs and EIPs are difficult to understand if you only read official technical documentation.

This project aims to:
- lower the learning barrier for Web3 beginners  
- explain standards in a visual and interactive way  
- help students build intuition through hands-on experience  

We believe **standards should be learned through usage, not memorization**.

## 📘 What can you learn?

- **EIP-1559**  
  A transaction pricing mechanism that includes fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes.

- **EIP-7702**  
  Adds a new transaction type that sets the code for an EOA for one transaction, enabling batching and sponsorship.

- **ERC-8004**  
  a decentralized protocol designed to enable open-ended agent economies by providing a standardized framework for discovering and establishing trust with agents across organizational boundaries through Identity, Reputation, and Validation registries,,.
